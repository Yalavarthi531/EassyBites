# Eassy Bites Website Walkthrough

I have successfully created the **Eassy Bites** website! Since Node.js was not available, I built a **high-performance static website** using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript.

## 🌿 Premium Nature Design Upgrade
I completely overhauled the design to match your request for a "modern, eco-friendly, close to nature vibe".

### 1. Hero Section
Features a custom-generated cinematic shot of the edible cup in a sunlit nature setting. The typography is now bolder with organic, rounded buttons.

### 2. Product Showcase
I replaced the placeholder with a high-detail studio shot of the cup, emphasizing its crunchy texture. The layout now uses soft shadows and a clean, airy feel.

### 3. Features & Ingredients
- **Nature Palette**: Used Coffee Brown, Leaf Green, and Biscuit Cream colors.
- **Organic Shapes**: Added rounded corners and subtle background textures to feel more natural.
- **Ingredients**: The "About Us" section now features a subtle background of natural ingredients (wheat, grains).

## 🛠️ Technical Details
- **Responsive**: The site adapts to mobile devices (includes a mobile menu).
- **Fast**: No heavy frameworks, just pure code.
- **Interactive**:
    - Smooth scrolling navigation.
    - Fade-in animations on scroll.
    - Hover effects on buttons and cards.
